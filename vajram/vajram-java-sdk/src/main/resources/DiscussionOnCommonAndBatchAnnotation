- @Batch
  - Only the facetValues (inputs and dependencies) that are annotated with @Batch will be included in the batchInterface,
  as we are assuming that in the final output logic only those will be required

- @Common
  - The facetValues that are annotated with @Common will be included in the commonInterface,
  as we are assuming that in the final output logic only those will be required
  - For backward compatibility, if there is no facet annotated with @Common, then all the facetValues which are not
  annotated with @Batch will be assumed @Common and included in the commonInterface (? to confirm with Ram as this might get confusing along with below point)

  There might be facetValues which are not annotated with @Batch or @Common, but are required to compute dependencies before final output logic,
  they will not be available in the final output logic to the vajram developer

  decided not to go with @Common annotation, instead @Batch(isRequiredInMainOutput = <ENUM>)
  will be used to include the facet in the main output logic (property name is not finalised, it is just an example) .
  Enum can have 3 value, default, true, false. default behavior the runtime actor can decide based on presence of delyable vajrams or not.
